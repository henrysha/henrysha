### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on Naver Shopping Search Services, and some vertical services in Shopping Domain @ [Naver](https://navercorp.com/)
- ✍️ I'm also helping out [Dancers Connect](https://github.com/dancersconnect) on building their first product based on [![Next.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/next.js-000000?style=for-the-badge&logo=nextdotjs&logoColor=white
)](https://nextjs.org/)

I love creating services that impact people's lives.

Though my personal profile's contribution graph is a bit scarce, that does not necessarily mean that I don't code....
Most of my code relies on my company's git server, so that just doesn't get synced with my personal one. 😭

- 📸 I also love to take photos. I created a photography club during my college years, and that club still remains intact 😃
